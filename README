GMAIL IMAP TEMPLATE
=============

As I said before mocking Google for the lack of a Gmail API, we're 
forced to turn to IMAP. This being an exercise in python, I turned to 
the standard library docs, and got no help ... worse than no help, 
confusing 'help'. Next up, I think we should repent and turn to Google 
to help us find example code that will show us the proper way to deal 
with imaplib. 

To summarize the results ... crap. Some decent attempts, but mostly, as 
you can see in my references, crap. Don't trust my opinion? Fine, I 
never liked you anyway ...
